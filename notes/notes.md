## Personal Notes:

### Kali Linux Basics Preparation

- Ctrl+l in the File Manager of Kali OS Top Bar gives the location as CLI.
- [List of Linux Commands with Description](https://www.mediacollege.com/linux/command/linux-command.html)
- Upgrading the Virtual Box to version 6.
- Connected all the Machines to the common NAT NETWORK(Virtual Box > Network > Add New > Nat Network).
- Successfully connected to the webserver of the Metasploitable by getting the IP address and accessing it in Kali Linux.
- Nat Network is DHCP enabled so need to run ifconfig always to get the new IP Address
- Changed the Mutillidae's config.inc file to point to 'owasp10' db.
